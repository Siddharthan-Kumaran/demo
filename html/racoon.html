      The raccoon (/rəˈkuːn/ or US: /ræˈkuːn/ ⓘ, Procyon lotor), sometimes
      called the North American, northern or common raccoon (also spelled
      racoon)[3] to distinguish it from other species of raccoon, is a mammal
      native to North America. It is the largest of the procyonid family, having
      a body length of 40 to 70 cm (16 to 28 in), and a body weight of 5 to 26
      kg (11 to 57 lb). Its grayish coat mostly consists of dense underfur,
      which insulates it against cold weather. The animal's most distinctive
      features include its extremely dexterous front paws, its facial mask, and
      its ringed tail, which are common themes in the mythologies of the
      Indigenous peoples of the Americas surrounding the species. The raccoon is
      noted for its intelligence, and studies show that it can remember the
      solution to tasks for at least three years. It is usually nocturnal and
      omnivorous, eating about 40% invertebrates, 33% plants, and 27%
      vertebrates. The original habitats of the raccoon are deciduous and mixed
      forests. Still, due to their adaptability, they have extended their range
      to mountainous areas, coastal marshes, and urban areas, where some
      homeowners consider them to be pests. As a result of escapes and
      deliberate introductions in the mid-20th century, raccoons are now also
      distributed across central Europe, the Caucasus, and Japan. In Europe, the
      raccoon has been included on the list of Invasive Alien Species of Union
      Concern since 2016.[4] This implies that this species cannot be imported,
      bred, transported, commercialized, or intentionally released into the
      environment in the whole of the European Union.[5]

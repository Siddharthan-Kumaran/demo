    <p>
      Chess is a board game for two players. It is an abstract strategy game
      that involves no hidden information and no elements of chance. It is
      played on a square board consisting of 64 squares arranged in an 8×8 grid.
      The players, referred to as "White" and "Black", each control sixteen
      pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and
      eight pawns, with each type of piece having a different pattern of
      movement. An enemy piece may be captured (removed from the board) by
      moving one's own piece onto the square it occupies. The object of the game
      is to "checkmate" (threaten with inescapable capture) the enemy king.
      There are also several ways a game can end in a draw. The recorded history
      of chess goes back to at least the emergence of chaturanga—also thought to
      be an ancestor to similar games like xiangqi and shogi—in seventh-century
      India. After its introduction in Persia, it spread to the Arab world and
      then to Europe. The modern rules of chess emerged in Europe at the end of
      the 15th century, with standardization and universal acceptance by the end
      of the 19th century. Today, chess is one of the world's most popular
      games, with millions of players worldwide.
